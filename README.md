#God's Chosen..The..Truly Random Password Generator

I utilized an independent, self-regulating neural computation system to produce pseudo-randomized results through intrinsic cognitive heuristics, devoid of externally supplied entropy or algorithmic randomization techniques.

# Nothing Can Beat It!!

## Overview
This program generates a random password with a length between 10 and 22 characters. The password consists of a mix of:

- Numeric characters
- Uppercase letters
- Lowercase letters
- Special symbols

The password length is randomly selected from a predefined array of sizes. The program uses multiple functions to generate different types of characters and combines them to create a secure password.

## How It Works

### Random Size Selection
- The program starts by selecting a random size for the password from a predefined array of sizes (`sizes[]`).
- A pointer (`ptr`) is used to access the array, and the size is clamped between 10 and 22 to ensure it falls within the desired range.

### Character Generation
The program uses multiple functions to generate different types of characters:

- `characters()`: Generates random numeric characters (0-9).
- `realcharacters()`: Generates random uppercase letters.
- `realcharacterslower()`: Generates random lowercase letters.
- `symbols()`: Generates random symbols (e.g., !, @, #).
- `realcharacters2()` and `realcharacterslower2()`: Generate additional mixed characters.
- `symbols2()`: Generates more random symbols.

### Randomization
- The `rand()` function is used to generate random numbers, which are then mapped to specific characters or symbols in predefined arrays.
- The `srand(time(0))` function seeds the random number generator with the current time to ensure different passwords are generated each time the program runs.

### Output
- The program outputs the generated password directly to the console.

## Key Features
- **Dynamic Password Length:** The password length is randomly selected and adjusted to fall within the range of 10 to 22 characters.
- **Diverse Character Set:** The password includes a mix of numbers, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and symbols.
- **Modular Design:** The program is divided into multiple functions, each responsible for generating a specific type of character.

## Example Output
If the program selects a size of 16, the output might look like this:
```plaintext
5Gm}l#:-P;-)D
```

## How to Use

1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++):
   ```bash
   g++ password_generator.cpp -o password_generator
   ```
2. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./password_generator
   ```
3. The program will output a randomly generated password.

It's For Fun!!
